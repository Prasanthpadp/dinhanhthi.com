This is my note for the course ([Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)). The codes in this note are rewritten to be more clear and concise.

ðŸŽ¯ [Overview of all 5 courses.](/deeplearning-ai)

ðŸ‘‰ **Course 1** -- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](/deeplearning-ai-course-1).<br />
ðŸ‘‰ **Course 2** -- [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](/deeplearning-ai-course-2).<br />
ðŸ‘‰ **Course 3** -- [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](/deeplearning-ai-course-3).<br />
ðŸ‘‰ **Course 5** -- [Sequence Models](/deeplearning-ai-course-5).

This course will teach you how to build convolutional neural networks and apply it to image data.
