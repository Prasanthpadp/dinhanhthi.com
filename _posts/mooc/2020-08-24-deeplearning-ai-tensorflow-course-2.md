This is my note for the [2nd course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow) of [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) given by [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai/) and taught by Laurence Moroney on Coursera.

ðŸ‘‰ Check the codes [on my Github](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/deeplearning.ai-courses/tree/master/TensorFlow%20in%20Practice).<br />
ðŸ‘‰ Official [notebooks](https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse) on Github.

ðŸ‘‰ Go to [course 1 - Intro to TensorFlow for AI, ML, DL](/deeplearning-ai-tensorflow-course-1).<br />
ðŸ‘‰ Go to [course 3 - NLP in Tensorflow](/deeplearning-ai-tensorflow-course-3).
