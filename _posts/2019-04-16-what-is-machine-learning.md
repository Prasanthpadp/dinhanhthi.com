This is **the first post in the series** of posts I wrote about what I’ve learned in Machine Learning and Data Science on the online courses. I write these posts by supposing that there are some interviewers asking me some technical questions in these fields. I also write the answers in the context where someone doesn’t know anything about ML or Data ask about these fields.

{:.alert.alert-warning}
I typically focus on simple and more understandable answers. These posts aren’t the official and complete articles for such practical knowledge. You have to search and establish yourself the precise definitions and effective techniques outside these posts. If **you see I’m wrong somewhere**, please **let me know** at the comment section, thanks.

{:.question}
## What's Machine Learning?

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. -- [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/){:target="_blank"}.

Above definition was mentioned in the course of Andrew NG in his course on Coursera. **Shorter, for me,** ML is the science in that we give computers abilities to act without being explicitly programmed. They can learn from some given data (they can even collect data by themselves), using some algorithms and make the prediction.

## Differences between supervised learning / unsupervised learning?

- **Supervised learning** : output is already known.
- **Unsupervised learning**: We have very little or no idea what our results should look like.

{:.question}
## What's Data Science?

Data Science is the process of using data to understand different things, of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data in order to answer some questions.

{:.question}
## What's Big Data?

> Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can’t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before. -- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/big-data/guide/what-is-big-data.html){:target="_blank"}.

## What are differences between Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst?

- **Data Analyst** : *The bridge, the driver. From the past show the present*. They set the link between traditional business and the data driven, also between tech teams and business teams. They give advices to the managers based on the results to help them make better decisions. **Jobs** : data cleaning, performing analysis and creating data visualizations. 
- **Data Scientist** : *The brain, what are behind the scene. From the past, show the future.* They apply their expertise in statistics and building machine learning models to make predictions and answer key business questions. **Jobs** : clean, analyze, and visualize data (like data analyst but more depth) & are able to train and optimize machine learning models.
- **Data Engineer** : *The workers.* They prepare foundations for DS and DA. They have good software dev tools, build and perform systems for others to work.
