Evaluation metrics are used to explain the performance of a model. Basically, we can compare the *actual values* and the *predicted values* to calculate the accuracy of our models. In this post, I try to understand the meaning and usage of some popular errors in the model evaluation.

## What's an error of the model?

The error of the model is the difference between the data points and the trend line generated by the algorithm. There are many ways to calculate this difference.

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) : $MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n \vert y_j - \hat{y}_j \vert$.

## Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Root Mean Squared Error (RMSR)
