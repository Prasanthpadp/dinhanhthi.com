## What & Why?

To check the similar distribution of 2 samples drawn from population. If these samples are normal, we can use T-test, but if <mark>they are not normal</mark>, we need to use KS-test. KS-test is a <mark>non-parametric test</mark>.

Null hypothesis ($H_0$): "_Two samples drawn from population with the same distribution_."

ðŸ‘‰ Read more about [p-value](/p-value). We use this value to evaluate the true/false of above null hypothesis.

The difference (in use) of **T-test** (need an assumption of nomality) and **KS-test** (don't need),

![T-test vs KS-test]({{img-url}}/t-test-ks-test.png)

- Two samples have the same mean & standard deviation â‡’ p-value is high â‡’ cannot reject $H_0$ (not true)
- KS-test can detect the variance â‡’ p-value is low â‡’ we can reject $H_0$ â‡’ 2 samples are not the same distribution!!! (yep!)

## How?

## Code?

~~~ python
from scipy import stats
