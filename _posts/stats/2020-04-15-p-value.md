## Null hypothesis

- **Null hypothesis** ⇒ questions scientist want to nullify.
  - Example: $H_0$ = "The world is flat."
- **Alternate hypothesis**: "The world is round."
- In order to change an opinion, we first prove it wrong!

## p-value

- **Small** p-value ⇒ **reject** null hypothesis!
- Mostly, we need $p<0.05$ (**_statistical significance_**) to <mark>reject a null hypothesis</mark>.
  - Smaller $0.05$, we are more sure!
- Example: "_Gender IS NOT linked to pet preference (cat/dog)_.". With $p=0.043<0.05$, we reject that hypothesis and conclude "_Gender IS linked to pet preference_.".{% ref https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/chi-square-test.html %}

### How to read p-value?

If $p=0.75$, it means that there are $75\%$ the null hypothesis is true! We cannot reject it!

## Calculate p-value

In order to calculate p-value, we use **Chi-Square Test** ($X^2$ test).

- This test only works for categorical data (Men, Women), not numerical data (height, weight).
- The number of entries must be large enough.
