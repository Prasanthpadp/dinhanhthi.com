## Idea?

- [1] very effective at computer vision (e.g. recognizing cats, dogs, planes, and even hot dogs)
- Why not feedforward neural networks?
  - do not take into account the spatial structure of the pixels
  - feedforward neural networks learn global relationships in the features instead of local patterns.
