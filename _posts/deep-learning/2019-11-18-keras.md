## Installation

~~~ python
activate base
conda install keras
~~~

Sometimes, you need to update `pip` (see [this note](/python-installation#install-packages-with-pip)) and `tensorflow`,

~~~ python
# update tensorflow
activate base
pip install tensorflow --upgrade
~~~

If you run some keras code and meet something like that `module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'get_default_graph'`,

~~~ python
# instead of using
from keras...

# use
from tensorflow.keras...
~~~
