## Installation

- Verify that your computer has a graphic card (NVIDIA): `lspci -nn | grep '\[03'`
- Check the CUDA version on Ubuntu: `nvidia-smi`.
- Install the lates version: [here](https://pytorch.org/).

### Problem with CUDA version

For example, need to install corresponding versions: `torch==1.2.0` ← `torchvision==0.4.0` ← `Pillow<7.0.0`

~~~ bash
pip3 install -U torch==1.2.0
pip3 install -U torchvision==0.4.0
pip3 install -U "pillow<7"
~~~

### NVIDIA too old

Problem `The NVIDIA driver on your system is too old (found version 10010)`.

From [this website](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/old-cuda-driver-with-pytorch-1-5/78470/5), problem is solved by

1. Switching from `nvidia-driver-435` to `nvidia-driver-440`.
2. Restart the computer.

It works on Dell XPS 7950 whose GPU is NVIDIA GTX 1650.

## Import

~~~ python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim
~~~

## Device's info

~~~ python
print('cuda is available? ', torch.cuda.is_available())
print('device_count: ', torch.cuda.device_count())
print('current device: ', torch.cuda.current_device())
print('device name: ', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
~~~

### Determine supported device

~~~ python
def get_device():
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        device = torch.device('cuda:0') # or something else
    else:
        device = torch.device('cpu') # don't have GPU
    return device
~~~

## Convert DataFrame / Series to Tensor

~~~ python
def df_to_tensor(df):
    device = get_device() # see other section
    return torch.from_numpy(df.values).float().to(device)
~~~
