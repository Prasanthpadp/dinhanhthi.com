1. You must have Windows 10: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later). Check [other requirements](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install).
  ~~~ bash

Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | % Caption
# check window build number
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | % Buildnumber
  ~~~
2. Active **Hyper-V** and **Containers** (you can do it manually in **Turn Windows features on or off**)
  ~~~ bash
# Open PowerShell with Administrator and run following
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName containers –All
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V –All
# restart

1. [Download](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) and install.
2. Check `docker version`.
