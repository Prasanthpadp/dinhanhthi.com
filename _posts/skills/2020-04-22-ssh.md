## How it works?

1. Local creates `public_key` (`id_rsa.pub`) & `private_key` (`id_rsa`).
2. Only `private_key` can understand `public_key`.
3. Remote sends messages encrypted based on `public_key`.
4. Local has to use `private_key` to understand (decrypt) remote's messages.

## Generate a public key

- **Windows**: Using below command, if it asks for a location, indicate `C:\Users\dinha\.ssh\`
- **Linux**: `/home/thi/.ssh/`
   ~~~ bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

   # without email
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.home
   ~~~

### Multiple ssh keys

1. Create key with different names, e.g. `id_rsa.home`, `id_rsa.work`.
2. Add to `~/.ssh/config`,
   ``` bash
   Host home
   Hostname home.example.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.home
   User <your home acct>

   Host work
   Hostname work.example.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.work
   User <your work acct>
   ```
3. Add to ssh-agent (don't need to retype password again)
   ``` bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.home
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.work
   ```
4. Don't forget to clone you repo with `git` instead of `https`.

## Add public key to remote

Suppose that we wanna connect to a remote host `username@remote.com` from a local machine.

1. On local machine, copy public key at `C:/Users/dinha/.ssh` (Windows) and `~/.ssh` (Linux) (something like `id_rsa.pub`) (copy its content).
2. On remote server (Linux), go to `~/.ssh`, open file **authorized_keys** by `vim authorized_keys`
   1. Be carefull, you can modify the current keys!
   2. Go to the end of this file (by <kbd>W</kbd>)
   3. Press <kbd>I</kbd> to enter to the editing mode, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for a new line.
   4. Using mouse to copy/paste the key in the 1st step (on your local machine).
   5. Note that, each key stays in a separated line.
   6. <kbd>ESC</kbd> and then type `:wq` to quick and save.
   7. Try to connect again!

## Connecting

~~~ bash
ssh remote_username@remote_host
ssh remote_username@remote_host -p remote_port
~~~

<div class="flex-auto-equal-2" markdown="1">
~~~ bash
# CHECK VERSION
ssh -V
~~~

~~~ bash
# DISCONNECT
exit
~~~

~~~ bash
# COPY FILE: LOCAL -> REMOTE
scp local_file user@remote-host:/var/tmp/
~~~

~~~ bash
# REMOTE -> LOCAL
scp user@remote-host:/usr/local/bin/add.sh .
~~~

``` bash
# pass inside the command
sudo apt-get install sshpass
sshpass -p your_password ssh user@hostname
```

## Command line parameters

~~~ bash
# FOR EXAMPLE
ssh -C # use data compression
