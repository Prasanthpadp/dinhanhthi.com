## Build

``` bash
# install nodejs
# https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#installation-instructions

npm install

# build + watch + test (locally + WITH performing tasks on images)
npm run watch

# Setting up on Netlify
npm run build
```

## Dev locally

Because of the weakness of eleventy, we have to do below things to make the dev locally much faster!

``` bash
# Install http-server to make a separated server
# (we don't intend to serve our eleventy site, just build it)
sudo npm install http-server -g

# Run the serve on folder _live
npm run local-serve

# Each time we want to build, run
npm run local-build
```
