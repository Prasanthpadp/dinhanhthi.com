There are some facts:

1. The notes **are not** tutorials!
2. The notes **are not** written by a pro but a bookworm.
3. The notes **are not** complete!
4. The notes are **always updated** without notice!
5. The notes **always indicate the sources** if the ideas **are not** mine!
6. The notes **sometimes contains the mistakes** and I need you to help me fix them.
7. The notes have **new brothers** day by day.
8. The note with small dot (<sup>â€¢</sup>) at the end of the title is **not good enough**!

Thanks and welcome to my [world of notes](/notes).
