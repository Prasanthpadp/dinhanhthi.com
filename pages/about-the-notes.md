I'm not a teacher with my notes, I'm a constantly self-learning guy. These are some facts:

1. The notes aren't the tutorials!
2. The notes aren't written by a pro but a bookworm. 
3. The notes aren't complete!
4. The notes are always updated without notice!
5. The notes always indicate the sources if the ideas aren't mine!
6. The notes always contains the mistakes and I need you to help me fix them.
7. The notes have new brothers day by day.

Thanks and welcome to my world of notes.
