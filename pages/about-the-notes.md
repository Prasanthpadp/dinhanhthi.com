I'm not a teacher with my notes, I'm a constantly self-learning guy. These are some facts:

1. The notes are not the tutorials!
2. The notes are not written by a pro but a bookworm. 
3. The notes are not complete!
4. The notes are always updated without notice!
5. The notes always indicate the sources if the ideas are not mine!
6. The notes always contains the mistakes and I need you to help me fix them.
7. The notes have new brothers day by day.

Thanks and welcome to my world of notes.
