## Tips

### Collecting

1. Find a hammer (or something to hew down a tree) around some **Stable**.
2. Treasure chest shrine indicator on the map (right on the right of a shrine's name) where you forgot to collect all of them.
3. **Grab fairies** (used to revive): find them near any of the **Great Fairy Fountain** or hiding in tall grass.
	1. **Find Great Fairy Fountain**: using [this interactive map](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/breath-of-the-wild-interactive-map/).
4. **Expand inventory space**: talk to **Hestu** and pay him **korok**.
	1.  **Find korok seeds**: using [this interactive map](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/breath-of-the-wild-interactive-map/))
	2.  **Find Hestu**: first time in the south of Kakariko village (solve _The Priceless Maracas quest_.), check more [in this guide](https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/Hestu#Where_Can_You_Find_Hestu.3F)).
	3.  **Cost**: 1 for the first upgrade, 2 for 2nd, 3 for 3rd, 5 for 4th and so on.
5. **Change the element of Chuchu Jelly**: _hitting a chuchu by a fire arrow_ / _drop them on fire_ makes a red chuchu, for example! + **Use chuhu** to trap enemies.
6. Fight **silver enemies** to get more valuable items.
7. Using wood shield to **collect arrows** from enemies (when they shoot you).


### Moving

1. You can make a **shield surfing** with holding a shiled ([[ZL]]) then [[X]] then [[A]].
2. Feed your **horse** with a increasing-stamina food, you can temporarily expand your horse's stamina.
3. **Type of horses**: spotted (slower + easier to tame), one colored (quicker + harder to tame).
4. **Create an updraft** by lighting grass on fire.
5. Using the final breath when climbing (press [[X]]).
6. **Revive a horse**: seek Malanya Spring > Highland Stable head south east towards the horse god bridge > the end of the path > find something looks like a Great Fairy but not. **Cost**: 1000 rubies.


### Upgrading

1. Go up the hill from the shrine in Kakariko village $\Rightarrow$ find **a plant pod**.
2. Reassign heat container and stamina vessels: in **Hatano village**, status at the bottom of the hill on the other side of the village entrance.

### Battling

1. You can use **Stasis** to freeze an enemy for a short time and then hit it.
2. Master sword beam: full health + [[R]] (not throwing your sword).
3. You can use shield t	o counter-attack (deflect) to enemies' blow (including Guardians): press [[A]] right before it lands for a **Perfect guard**.
4. **Perfect dodge**: jump out of the way of an attack right before it's about to hit you and then [[Y]] to perform the attack flurry.
