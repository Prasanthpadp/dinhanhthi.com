## What are differences between Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst?

- **Data Analyst** : *The bridge, the driver. From the past show the present*. They set the link between traditional business and the data driven, also between tech teams and business teams. They give advices to the managers based on the results to help them make better decisions. **Jobs** : data cleaning, performing analysis and creating data visualizations. 
- **Data Scientist** : *The brain, what are behind the scene. From the past, show the future.* They apply their expertise in statistics and building machine learning models to make predictions and answer key business questions. **Jobs** : clean, analyze, and visualize data (like data analyst but more depth) & are able to train and optimize machine learning models.
- **Data Engineer** : *The workers.* They prepare foundations for DS and DA. They have good software dev tools, build and perform systems for others to work.
