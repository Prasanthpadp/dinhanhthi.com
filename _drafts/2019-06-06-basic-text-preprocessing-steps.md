I wanna write about some basic text preprocessing steps. I wanna understand the **purposes** (*Why we need them?*), their **basic concepts** (*What they actually do?*), the **idea of implementing** them (*How can we build ourself a tool for this purpose?*). If it's possible, I'll write some python codes for them.

In this article, I'll learn about: *Lower casing*, *Spelling correction*, *Punctuation removal*, *Tokenization*, *Stopwords removal*, *Stemming*, *Frequent or rare words removal*, *Lemmatatization*.

## Lower casing


## Spelling correction, 


## Punctuation removal, 


## Tokenization, 


## Stopwords removal, 


## Stemming, 


## Frequent or rare words removal, 


## Lemmatatization.
