I spent 2 months to finish [this specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate){:target="_blank"}. It seems to be long because I don't focus 100% for this, it seems to be short because I have some knowledge before taking these courses. For me, this specialization of IBM is great for ones who want to have a very general look at Data Science and Machine Learning. I take this specialization as the last of "Beginner Level" courses before going to the "intermediate and case-studied" courses about Machine Learning and Data Science.

The specialization contains **9 different courses** covering almost all basic stuffs of Machine Learning and Data Science.

## TL;DR;

- **Course 1 & 2 - What's Data Science & Open source tools for DS** : What's DS? What Data Scientist do? Some popular applications of DS in real world? Some open source applications you can use to work with DS.
- **Course 3 - Data Science Methodology** : Draw a big picture about the procedure of a DS project. All steps and the relation between them are introduced.
- **Course 4 - Python for DS** :
