With this series, you are able to create yourself a static website like mine using some useful frameworks and services. I suppose that you have a little knowledge in web design (HTML, CSS) to make a your-style design. This series introduce about a big picture of Jekyll's structure and the super power of Bootstrap in designing a website. You'll see that, it's not too difficult to design a static website like mine.


## You just want to apply some theme?

In the case you have zero knowldege about HTML, CSS or programming. You just want to apply some [already-constructed templates](http://jekyllthemes.org/){:target="_blank"}. You can follow this section to archieve this. After these steps, you are able to make a website with such given themes.

### How to create a Github Page?

1. [Create](https://github.com/join?source=header-home){:target="_blank"} a Github account, don't forget to verify your email before loging in. I suppose that you signed up with name `dinhanhthi`.
2. Login to your Github account.
3. Create a new repository by clicking **New** on the right side of *Repositories* section and naming your repo with `<your-account>.github.io`. For example, my Github account is "*dinhanhthi*", so I name this repo "*dinhanhthi.github.io*". We need to name the repo like this because your website will have an address like **https://\<your-account\>.github.io**.
4. Basically, you now have a place where you can put your website, you can choose either a built-in theme from Github or an external theme. 
  - If you wanna create immediately a buit-in theme from Github, please continue to step 5.
	- If you wanna apply an external theme, please step to next section and ignore following steps in this section.
5. On your repo on github, click on tab **Settings**, on the left hand side, choose tab **Options** (default) and then go to section **Github Pages**, click on **Choose a theme**.
6. Choose a theme you like and then click on **Select theme**
7. A new page appears, write something on **Commit changes** and then click on **Commit changes**.
8. Done, now you have a page, check it out at **https://\<your-account\>.github.io**.
